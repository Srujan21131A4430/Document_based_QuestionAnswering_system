# Document_based_QuestionAnswering_system
This project focused on building an intelligent Q&A system capable of extracting and processing text from PDF documents to provide accurate, context-based answers. Leveraging the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, the system could understand and respond to user queries by parsing documents.
